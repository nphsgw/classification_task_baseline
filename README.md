# classification_task_baseline

## Overview
This repository is a compilation of the author's journey and learnings in the realm of image classification tasks. It is crafted to serve as a baseline and a starting guide for beginners venturing into the field of image recognition. The repository is structured around a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook (`cifar10_train.ipynb`) that encapsulates the entire process from training to inference, using the CIFAR-10 dataset as a foundational example.

## Features
- **Beginner-Friendly Guide**: The content is organized to assist beginners in understanding the fundamental concepts and steps involved in image classification tasks.
- **End-to-End Workflow**: The `cifar10_train.ipynb` notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of the entire workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation.
- **CIFAR-10 Dataset Example**: Utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset, a staple in the image classification domain, to demonstrate the training and inference process.
